<p>I am obsessed with cats! I have two, one is a domestic shorthair and the other one is a calico. They 
    are truly my whole entire life. They are so affectionate and loving and they are so cute. I volunteer 
    every Saturday at Petsmart in the adoption centre and take care of the cats. They are always so loving
    and when people ask to adopt them it is the most amazing feeling ever!

<h1>My journey into UX</h1>
<p>When I was younger, I always loved playing with computers. I would create song lyric videos and post them 
    onto Youtube so others can sing along. I would also edit videos and post them as well. One day, I was watching 
    a Youtube and I came across this youtuber that goes by the name "nameishana." She would film her daily vlogs 
    about how she got into UX and show her desktop setup and everything. I was immediately intrigued. I instatnly
    knew that is what I wanted to pursue. I wanted to be a User experience designer. So I researched different 
    programs and bootcamps, and I came across Humber's MMDD program. I applied and got in. I'm always learning
    new things and can't wait to start designing with a great team!
